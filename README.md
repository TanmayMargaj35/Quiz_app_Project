🧠 Quiz App  
Personal Project

📌 Overview  
This is a personal **web development project** where I built a **Simple Quiz App** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to attempt multiple-choice questions, test their knowledge, and view the next question with a click — all through real-time interaction on the web page.

🎯 Objectives  
- Create an interactive quiz experience using JavaScript  
- Learn how to manage dynamic content updates (questions/answers)  
- Strengthen skills in event handling, DOM manipulation, and UI feedback  
- Build a responsive and clean UI for seamless user experience

🧠 Features  
- Display of multiple-choice questions with answer buttons  
- Dynamic question and answer rendering  
- "Next" button to proceed through the quiz  
- Visual feedback for interaction (can be extended with scoring, correct/wrong indicators)  
- Mobile-responsive design

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript   
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

🚀 How It Works  
1. Questions and answers are rendered dynamically in the UI  
2. User selects one answer per question  
3. Clicking the **Next** button moves to the following question  
4. You can customize question data, add scoring logic, or track correct answers
